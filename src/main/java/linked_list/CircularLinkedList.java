/**
 * There are many applications in which data can be more naturally viewed as having a cyclic order, with well-defined neighboring relationships,
 * but no fixed beginning or end. For example, many multiplayer games are turn-based, with player A taking a turn,
 * then player B, then player C, and so on, but eventually back to player A again, and player B again, with the pattern repeating.
 * As another example, city buses and subways often run on a continuous loop, making stops in a scheduled order,
 * but with no designated first or last stop per se. We next consider another important example of a cyclic order in the context of computer operating systems.
 * <p/>
 * As another example, Round-Robin Scheduling - Each active process is given its own time slice, taking turns in a cyclic order.
 * New processes can be added to the system, and processes that complete their work can be removed.
 * <p/>
 * We use this model to design and implement a new CircularlyLinkedList class, which supports all of the public behaviors of our SinglyLinkedList class
 * and one additional update method: rotate():	Moves the first element to the end of the list.
 * With this new operation, round-robin scheduling can be efficiently implemented by repeatedly performing the following steps on a circularly linked list C:
 * Give a time slice to process C.first(); C.rotate()

     * as it removes the need to perform additional operations to keep a head reference current.
     * In fact, our new implementation is arguably superior to our original singly linked list implementation, even if we are not interested in the new rotate method
